# Schedim: a browser game

Schedim is a reference implementation for the Little Goblin Grails plugin.
The documentation of Little Goblin provides a step-by-step explanation how to build a game, using Schedim as an example.

Since the work on both the framework and the game is far from finished,
this is a work in progress.
